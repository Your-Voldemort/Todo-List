## 🆘 Common Questions

### Q: Where should I start?
**A:** Start with [QUICK_START_UPGRADES.md](QUICK_START_UPGRADES.md) - it has copy-paste ready code for the most critical upgrades.

### Q: How long will this take?
**A:** 
- Quick wins: 48 hours
- Production-ready: 2 weeks (40 hours)
- Full implementation: 2 months (150+ hours)

### Q: What if I don't have much budget?
**A:** Start with the free/cheap options in Quick Wins. You can run production infrastructure for $50-100/month using DigitalOcean or Railway.

### Q: Do I need all these upgrades?
**A:** No! Focus on:
1. Security (rate limiting, headers) - CRITICAL
2. Infrastructure (Docker, PostgreSQL) - CRITICAL
3. Monitoring (logging, health checks) - HIGH
4. Features - based on your needs

### Q: Can I deploy without Docker?
**A:** Yes, but Docker makes deployment MUCH easier. It's worth the 4-hour investment.

### Q: What about testing?
**A:** Testing infrastructure is in [UPGRADE_ROADMAP.md](UPGRADE_ROADMAP.md) Phase 7. Start with critical path tests, expand coverage over time.
